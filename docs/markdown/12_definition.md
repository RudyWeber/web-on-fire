# Définition

Notes:
Progressive Web Apps are really a response to changes we've seen on the web, an attitude to building great experiences.

Making the most of the reach and capabilities of the platform — but also showing respect to users by being honest about real world constraints on connectivity and devices.

But... What does this actually mean in practice?

# Au delà du buzz word

Notes:
Souvent réduit à “une web app installable” -> fausse impression de nouvelle plateforme / type d’app

De nouvelles technos pour un MEILLEUR web, sans oublier les best practices “historiques” !

Notes:
One way to think of the difference between native and web apps is on the capability axis. 
Native apps start quickly when you tap the icon. Native apps tend to work offline, they can show notifications, sync in the background, and they have access to sensors like the camera and microphone. 
But, their reach is somewhat limited, requiring a different version for each platform.
The web is safer, and it’s permission model is more respectful of your privacy, but without the same capabilities, it doesn’t matter how many people can access it.

Notes:
We need to combine the capabilities and experience people are used to in native apps, with the reach of the web. 
We want the best of both worlds. 
A Progressive Web App is simply that, a great user experience that feels integrated and earns a place on your homescreen, without having to give up the reach of the web to get it.
