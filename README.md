### Demo App

#### Variations

You could also run some variations that you could find in `/steps`.

To do so, run:

1. `npm run api`
1. (in another terminal) `npm run step --step=<dirname>`

## :warning: Warning: May Contain Hot Topics

This project may contain a bunch of work in progress as I use it mainly to experiment new modern web capabilities and approach, in order to demontrate them during my talks. As a result, there is a good chance that some part of it simply doesn't work, or that the documentation will not be sufficient by itself to allow a complete understanding. _This is especially the case with "steps" (`/steps` & `npm run step --step="step-name"`)._

**Please, open an issue if you have any question, request or suggestion!**

If you need some more complete, step-by-step and stable learning material, I highly recommend you to check the PWA [SFEIR School](https://github.com/sfeir-open-source/sfeir-school-pwa)!

## Acknowledgements

This project was originally derived from the Open Source PWA [SFEIR School](https://github.com/sfeir-open-source/sfeir-school-pwa) I contributed to re-design and update between late 2018 and early 2019.

This wouldn't have been possible without the following people! A big thanks to them all!
